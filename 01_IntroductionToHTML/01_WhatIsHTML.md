<b>HTML</b> stands for ```Hypertext Markup Language```. It is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. HTML provides a way to define the structure of a web page's content using various elements and tags, which are then interpreted by web browsers to render the content visually.

HTML documents consist of a collection of these elements and tags, each serving a specific purpose. For instance:

- **Headings:** HTML provides headings from `<h1>` (the highest level) to `<h6>` (the lowest level) to structure content hierarchically.

- **Paragraphs:** The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs of text.

- **Links:** The `<a>` tag creates hyperlinks that connect different web pages or resources. It allows users to navigate through the internet.

- **Images:** The `<img>` tag is used to embed images into web pages.

- **Lists:** HTML supports both unordered lists (bulleted) and ordered lists (numbered), created using `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags, respectively.

- **Forms:** HTML provides a way to create interactive forms for user input, including text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and more.

- **Semantic Elements:** HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and more, which add meaning to the structure of a webpage and aid accessibility.

- **Tables:** The `<table>` tag is used to create tables for tabular data, and rows and cells are defined using `<tr>` and `<td>` or `<th>` (table headers) tags.

HTML documents are saved with a `.html` extension and are opened and interpreted by web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Browsers read the HTML code and render it into a visual layout that users can interact with. It's important to note that HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, but for styling (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript), additional technologies are used.
