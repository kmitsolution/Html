# HTML Versions

HTML has evolved over the years with various versions, each introducing new features, improvements, and better support for modern web development practices. Here are the major versions of HTML:

**1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The original version of HTML. It laid the foundation for structuring content on the web. Features included headings, paragraphs, lists, and basic formatting. This version is often referred to as HTML 2.0.

**2. HTML 3.2:** Introduced tables for layout and some basic form elements. This version marked a significant step towards more complex web page structures.

**3. HTML 4.01:** Released in 1999, HTML 4.01 introduced more advanced features like framesets, better forms, and support for scripting languages like JavaScript. It included both strict and transitional doctypes to handle varying levels of markup rigor.

**4. XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language):** XHTML was an attempt to reformulate HTML as an XML application. It aimed to bring stricter rules to HTML and improve compatibility with XML tools. XHTML 1.0 was introduced as a transitional step towards more rigorous markup.

**5. HTML5:** HTML5, released in 2014, is the most significant and modern version of HTML. It brought a host of new features and APIs for enhanced multimedia support, better semantics, improved form handling, and more. Some key features of HTML5 include:

   - Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc., which provide clearer structure.
   - Audio and video elements: `<audio>` and `<video>` for embedding multimedia.
   - Canvas and SVG for graphics.
   - Improved forms with new input types like date, email, number, etc.
   - Local Storage and Web Storage for client-side data storage.
   - Web Workers and WebSockets for enhanced interactivity.
   - Geolocation API for location-based services.
   - Drag-and-drop support.
   - Accessibility improvements.

HTML5 marked a shift towards creating more dynamic and interactive web applications. Unlike previous versions, HTML5 doesn't require closing all tags and supports self-closing tags (e.g., `<img>`).

**6. HTML Living Standard:** The HTML Living Standard is an ongoing effort to maintain and improve HTML. It's managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). Rather than having distinct versions like HTML4 or XHTML, HTML is now seen as an evolving, living standard with continuous updates and improvements.

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, HTML5 and the HTML Living Standard are the current versions of HTML. It's recommended to stay up to date with web development communities and resources for the latest advancements beyond that point.
